        <item>The Sun (or Sol), is the star at the centre of our solar
            system and is responsible for the Earth’s climate and weather.
            The Sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just
            10km in diameter between the poles and the equator. The
            average radius of the Sun is 695,508 km (109.2 x that of
            the Earth) of which 20–25% is the core.</item>
        <item>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and due
            to its proximity it is not easily seen except during twilight.
            For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three
            rotations about its axis and up until 1965 it was thought that
            the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun. Thirteen
            times a century Mercury can be observed from the Earth passing
            across the face of the Sun in an event called a transit.</item>
        <item>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the second
            brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. Named
            after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the
            second largest terrestrial planet and is sometimes referred
            to as the Earth’s sister planet due the their similar size
            and mass. The surface of the planet is obscured by an opaque
            layer of clouds made up of sulphuric acid.</item>
        <item>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the
            largest of the terrestrial planets. The Earth is the only
            planet in our solar system not to be named after a Greek or
            Roman deity. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion
            years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</item>
        <item>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is the second
            smallest planet in the solar system. Named after the Roman
            god of war, Mars is also often described as the “Red Planet”
            due to its reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with
            a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide.</item>
        <item>The planet Jupiter is the fifth planet out from the Sun,
            and is two and a half times more massive than all the other
            planets in the solar system combined. It is made primarily
            of gases and is therefore known as a “gas giant”.</item>
        <item>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the most
            distant that can be seen with the naked eye. Saturn is
            the second largest planet and is best known for its fabulous
            ring system that was first observed in 1610 by the astronomer
            Galileo Galilei. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant and is
            composed of similar gasses including hydrogen, helium and
            methane.</item>
        <item>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It’s not visible
            to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with
            the use of a telescope. Uranus is tipped over on its side with
            an axial tilt of 98 degrees. It is often described as “rolling
            around the Sun on its side.”</item>
        <item>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun making it the most
            distant in the solar system. This gas giant planet may have
            formed much closer to the Sun in early solar system history
            before migrating to its present position.</item>
        <item>Discovered in 1930, Pluto is the second closest dwarf planet
            to the Sun and was at one point classified as the ninth planet.
            Pluto is the largest dwarf planet but only the second most
            massive, with Eris being the most massive.</item>
